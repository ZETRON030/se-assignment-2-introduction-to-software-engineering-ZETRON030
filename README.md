Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering: Can be define as the systematic application of engineering principles, methodologies and tools in the design, development, operation and maintenance of high quality software systems for end users.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? 

Software Engineering is the process of applying engineering practices and knowledge of programming languages to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain high quality software solutions. It is different from traditional programming in that it requires the services and collaboration of various software dicipline or field throughout the software development process.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Software Development Life Cycle, SDLC is simply the various phases in which the software development process is executed aimed at developing a software that meets industry standard and gaining user acceptance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

The various phases of  Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) includes the following:

Planning Phase: The planning phase is the initial phase of verifying the necessity of developing a new information system, and determining the process of building.

Requirement Phase: The requirements of the software are determined at this stage. Discussions are held between the various stake holders, managers, and users to find out what system requirements and documentations will needed for the software design. It is the second phase of the software development life cycle is and its often done concurrently with the first. 

Design Phase: During this phase of the System Development Life Cycle, the requirements and desired functions are described in great detail i.e operation, hardware and software needs, user interaction and other aspects of the system in detail. the idea of a high level and detail design of the software architecture and user interface is created.

Implimentation Phase: This is considered the sixth phase in the process and it begins when a huge part of the program code is written and completed. This phase also involves the actual installation of the newly-developed software application.This phase is in most projects the most expensive and longest production phase.

Testing: In this stage, you look for deficiencies and flaws in your software. You fix those problems until the solution meets the funtional requirements, industry standards and user acceptance. here various test plans are executed.

Deployment Phase: The newly developed software application is finally released to the public users after a successfully execution of various test plan to acertain the quality of the software application.

Maintenance Phase:This marks the final phase of the software development life cycle and it occurs during the effective use of the product by end users.At this stage continous Provision of updates and
technical support aimed at improving the features and functionality of the software application is considered.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

A sharp contrast  between waterfall model and Agile model is that waterfall model is a linear and sequential model which means that a development phase cannot begin until the previous phase is completed, while Agile model is a combination of both iterative and incremental models which encourages the need to begin the next phase even when the current phase is not completed. 

The key differences between Waterfall Model and Agile Models of Software Development is outlined as follows:

1. phases can not be overlaped in waterfall model while in Agile model phases can be overlaped.
2.In the waterfall model, the output of one phase serves as the input for the other phase while this is not the case in Agile model as it was created mainly to make changes in the middle of software development.
3.In the agile model, the software product is divided into small incremental parts. In this, the smallest part is developed first and then the larger one.And each incremental part is developed over iteration.
4. The first phase of softawre development life cycle in a waterfall model might be different from the first phase in Agile model.

Waterfall Model is adopted in scenarios were a simple and easy to understand model is required and is very useful for small projects as end goal is determined early.conversely, Agile Model is adopted depending on the complexity of the project. Its focus is on team work and a customer representative must be included among the software development team.

 What is Requirements Engineering?

Requirements Engineering: The area of systems engineering that deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. It invloves the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of end users. Following good requirements engineering practices helps achieve the primary objective of making sure that the delivered system meets the customer's needs.

 Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

 the process and importance of requirement engineering in software development lifecycle is describe as follows:

1. The feasibility study mainly concentrates on five mentioned areas which include; Technical Feasibility were current resources both software and hardware along required technology are analyzed and access to develop the project, Operational Feasibility,Economic Feasibility . Among these, Economic Feasibility Study is the most important part of the feasibility analysis and the Legal Feasibility Study is least considered.

2.Requirements Elicitation:It is related to the various ways used to gain knowledge about the project domain and requirements. The various sources of domain knowledge include customers, business manuals, the existing software of the same type, standards, and other stakeholders of the project. several technique such as interview, survey, focus group, observation and prototyping are employed.

3.Requirements Specification:This activity is used to produce formal software requirement models. All the requirements including the functional as well as the non-functional requirements and the constraints are specified by these models in totality.

4.Requirements Verification and Validation:
Verification: It refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function. While,

Validation: It refers to a different set of tasks that ensures that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements. If requirements are not validated, errors in the requirement definitions would propagate to the successive stages resulting in a lot of modification and rework.

5.Requirements Management: Requirement management is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders. This stage takes care of the changing nature of requirements.Several key activities are involved in requirements management, including;Tracking and controlling changes,keeping track of different version,Traceability,Communication,Monitoring and reporting.

Software Design Principles: 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. 

 Module simply means the software components that are been created by dividing the software. The software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item but sometimes they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other. this process of creating software modules is known as Modularity in software engineering. It simply measures the degree to which these components are made up than can be combined. Some of the projects or software designs are very complex that it’s not easy to understand its working and functioning. In such cases, modularity is a key weapon that helps in reducing the complexity of such software or projects.The basic principle of Modularity is that “Systems should be built from cohesive, loosely coupled components (modules)” which means system should be made up of different components that are united and work together in an efficient way and such components have a well-defined function.To define a modular system, several properties or criteria, this includes;Modular Decomposability,Modular Composability,Modular Understandability, Modular Continuity and Modular Protection. in a more simplified term Modularity refers to an organizing structure in which different components of a software system are divided into separate functional units.

How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity improves maintainability and scalability such that if changes are needed, they can be made to individual modules without impacting the entire system and This flexibility is key when scaling your application to handle increased loads or adding new features.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).

in software testing, there are four levels which are discuss as follows:

Unit Testing:In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software.

Integration Testing:In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected.

System Testing:In system testing, complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.

Acceptance Testing:This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment.

 Why is testing crucial in software development?

 To assure and maintain the quality of software and to represent the ultimate review of specification, design, and coding, Software testing is required.This activity performed is aimed at identifying errors so that errors can be removed to obtain a product with greater quality.

Version Control Systems: What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development?

 version control system (VCS) are software development tools that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. It is a system that records changes to a file or sets of files over time so that you can recall.It also enables collaboration between team members.By providing a centralized repository, these systems enable better code management, collaboration, and accountability.

Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

examples of version control sytem iincludes the following;

Git:Git is known for its speed, workflow compatibility, and open source foundation. Most Git actions only add data to the database, and Git makes it easy to undo changes during the three main states. Git has three file states: modified , staged , and committed . note that Git support collaboration, makes branching easier, create backup and support non-linear development too.

Apache Subversion:is version control system which is free and open-source, enables programmers to manage both the most recent and previous iterations of crucial files. It can track modifications to source code, web pages, and documentation for large-scale projects.Subversion’s main features are workflow management, user access limits, and cheap local branching. Both commercial products and individual projects can be managed using Subversion, a centralized system with many powerful features


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. 

The role of a software project manager is outline and discuss as follows:

1.project Proposal: it is the sole responsibility of the project manager to prepare a detailed proposal of the proposed software project.

2.Project Estimation:Project Size Estimation is the most significant parameter based on which all other estimations like cost, duration and effort are made and this is the responsibility of a project manager to do.

3.Scheduling: After the completion of the estimation of all the project parameters, scheduling for manpower and other resources is done by the project mnanager.

4.Staffing: Team structure and staffing plans are made.

5.Risk Management: The project manager should be able to foresee the unanticipated risks that may occur during project development, analyze the damage that might cause these risks, and take a risk reduction plan to cope with these risks.

6. the software project manager generally oversee the planning, control, execution and completion of the project from start to finish and must possess good decision making skills, maintain good communication to customers amongs other quality.

What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

1.Scope creep:Clients who don’t precisely know what they want and have vague requirements are one of the biggest project management challenges for both managers and the project team.

2.Poor communication
3.Misalignment between goals and business objectives.
4.Poor budgeting
5.Skill gaps
6.Insufficient risk analysis
7.Lack of accountability
8.Stakeholder disengagement
9.Poor planning and unrealistic deadlines

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. 

Software Maintenance: Refers to the process of modifying and updating a software system after it has been delivered to the customer. 

Different Types of software Maintenance Activities includes the following;

1.Corrective Maintenance: This involves fixing errors and bugs in the software system.

2.Patching: It is an emergency fix implemented mainly due to pressure from management. Patching is done for corrective maintenance but it gives rise to unforeseen future errors due to lack of proper impact analysis.

3.Adaptive Maintenance: This involves modifying the software system to adapt it to changes in the environment, such as changes in hardware or software, government policies, and business rules.

4.Perfective Maintenance: This involves improving functionality, performance, and reliability, and restructuring the software system to improve changeability.

5.Preventive Maintenance: This involves taking measures to prevent future problems, such as optimization, updating documentation, reviewing and testing the system, and implementing preventive measures such as backups.

6.Enhancements: The process of adding new features or improving existing features to meet the evolving needs of the users.

7.Performance Optimization: The process of improving the speed, efficiency, and reliability of the software.

8. Porting and Migration: The process of adapting the software to run on new hardware or software platforms.

9.Re-Engineering: The process of improving the design and architecture of the software to make it more maintainable and scalable.

10.Documentation: The process of creating, updating, and maintaining the documentation for the software, including user manuals, technical specifications, and design documents.


Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

It is a critical part of the software development life cycle (SDLC) due to the fact that it is necessary to ensure that the software continues to meet the needs of the users over time. software maintenance is a continuous process that occurs throughout the entire life cycle of the software system.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? 

1.Privacy: Handling, storing and sharing user data only under the circumstancies and purpose for which it was requested from the users.

Public: Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2.Client and employer: Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client
and employer consistent with the public interest.
